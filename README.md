### Objective: 
To monitor inventory health, track stock movement, identify slow-moving or dead stock, and support smarter procurement and warehouse decisions.

### Tools Used:  
Power BI

### Data Source:  
Sample inventory dataset containing SKU-level data, stock quantities, reorder levels, warehouse locations, and sales activity across 2024–2025.


### Key Features:

- Developed a clean and interactive dashboard with sections for **Inventory Overview**, **Dead Stock**, **Reorder Alerts**, and **Top Products**  
- Applied **Power Query** to clean and structure inventory data for smooth reporting  
- Built **DAX measures** to calculate stock turnover, days of inventory, stock value, and reorder needs  
- Integrated slicers for **Warehouse** and **Month-Year (2024–2025)** to allow dynamic filtering  
- Highlighted **top-performing products** and **slow-moving SKUs** to drive stocking decisions  


### Insights Derived:

- Certain products show consistently low sales over multiple months → dead stock risk  
- Warehouse A has excess stock of low-turnover SKUs compared to Warehouse B  
- Stock turnover rate is highest in electronics and seasonal product categories  
- Reorder alerts triggered for 15+ SKUs nearing minimum thresholds  
- Sales are more concentrated in Q1 and Q4, affecting stocking strategy


### Outcome/Value:  
This dashboard empowers inventory managers and warehouse teams to make **data-driven decisions** by identifying inefficiencies, minimizing overstock and stockouts, and maintaining optimal inventory levels throughout the year.
